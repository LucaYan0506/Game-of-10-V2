## Rule of the game
It is a maths based game. The are 2 players in this game. Initially, each player will have 6 cards:  
* 4 numbers
* 2 operations  

For each round the player needs to use as much operation as possible to create an equation that is equal to the power of 10. The player will get 1 point for each operation used. If the player used all the numbers, he will get 4 points. The player that reach 11 first wins.   
If in a round the player can't make an equation that is equal to the power of 10, he can skip that turn by discarding one card (therefore draw a new one).  
You can make horizontal and vertical equation. You can also use cards that are already placed in the table.
